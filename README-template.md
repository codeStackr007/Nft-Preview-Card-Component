### What I learned

Working on this NFT preview card was a journey, especially with the image overlay. The biggest challenge was getting the hover effect rightâ€”initially, the cyan overlay and "view" icon both faded because I used `opacity` on a `::before` with a background image. Switching the icon to a separate `<img>` and using `rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.5)` for the overlay background fixed it. I also learned to center the icon with `position: absolute` and `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`, which was a positioning win. Using `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1` with `max-width: 300px` kept the image wrapper square and consistentâ€”super useful! Hereâ€™s the code Iâ€™m proud of:

```html
<div class="nft__img-wrapper">
  <img src="/images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="NFT artwork" class="nft__img" />
  <img src="/images/icon-view.svg" alt="View icon" class="nft__icon" />
</div>
```

```css
.nft__img-wrapper {
  position: relative;
  max-width: 300px;
  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
}
.nft__img-wrapper::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0);
  border-radius: 10px;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
.nft__img-wrapper:hover::before {
  background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.5);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to dive deeper into CSS Grid for complex layouts and add animations to make hover effects more dynamic. I also plan to master media queries for better desktop designs.
